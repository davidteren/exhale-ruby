    exhale gates the exhale of every pull request in a Rails app. Its first check, exhale dry,
    sweeps the whole codebase for duplicated Ruby and ERB, scores near-copies by rarity-weighted
    structural similarity, and fails the build while any copy is undeclared. Deliberate
    duplication is declared in the Contract, next to the reason for it. Built on Prism and Herb.
